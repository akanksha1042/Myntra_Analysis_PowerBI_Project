## Myntra‘s fashion clothing!  With a robust dataset of over 5 lakh rows, the journey from data cleaning to insightful visualizations was both challenging and rewarding. Here's a glimpse into my process:

*** Data Cleaning and Transformation: Tackling a massive dataset requires meticulous data cleaning. Leveraging the power of DAX, I successfully sorted and transformed the data, overcoming one of the most challenging aspects of the project.

### Total Number of Products
*  Average Rating⋅
*  Average Number of Reviews. 
* Average Original Price.
* Average Discount Offered.
